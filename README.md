# Synthetic Control Methods (SCM) workshop

Here you can find all resources for the IAU workshop on an introduction to synthetic control methods and running a synthetic control analysis in R. This workshop aims to teach the basic principles of the original synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal  2003; Abadie et al. 2010) and how to run a synthetic control analysis to estimate the impact of an intervention on one or more treated units e.g. a GP practice. In this workshop we also run some introductory data checks and produce descriptive statistics to understand the structure of the fake dataset provided.

## Data source

This project does not use any real data. We created a fake dataset intended to replicate a GP practice panel data set where 40 GP practices from a CCG called "EA1" received an intervention aimed at reducing hospital utilisation and 100 GP practice did not.
